# Form and Form Server

This project demonstrates how to use forms and integrate them with a server to handle submissions. The server processes the form data, showcasing how backend and frontend interact in a simple web application.

## How to work with the server

To work with the server you have to first download this on your local machine, run 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ayomide-Philip/Form-and-Form-Server.git
```

## How to use the Server
You need to have Node on Your system, and to use the server, you need to run

```
cd "Form Server"
```
When you run that command it would change the directory to the form server directory.
